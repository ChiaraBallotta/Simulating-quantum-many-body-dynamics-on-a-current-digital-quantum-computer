# Simulating quantum many-body dynamics on a current digital quantum computer - Fopra 34
Study of the phenomenon of Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions (DQPTs) in a transverse field Ising model by converting the closed system quantum dynamics into a corresponding quantum circuit and extracting  relevant observables such as the magnetization, the Loschmidt echo, and the entanglement dynamics from it.

It contains:
- ` Ballotta_Ma_Palermo_Fopra34_code.ipynb` : code and implementantion
- ` Ballotta_Ma_Palermo_Fopra_34_report.pfd` :  introduction to simulation of many body systems, theoretical description of the model and analysis of the results obtianed from the simulation for the DQPTs of the Transverse Ising Model
