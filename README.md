# Simulating quantum many-body dynamics on a current digital quantum computer - Fopra 34
Study of the phenomenon of Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions (DQPTs) in a transverse field Ising model by converting the closed system quantum dynamics into a corresponding quantum circuit and extracting  relevant observables such as the magnetization, the Loschmidt echo, and the entanglement dynamics from it.
